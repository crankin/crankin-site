artonart.com is a calendar covering art and cultural events throughout the state of Texas. The calendar is searchable by date, location, type of event, type of organization, individual organization name, and by a regional map. The site also offers trip planning links and information. On average, artonart.com contains over 2,000 statewide events.

artonart.com was launched in 1997 with an interface based on a cartoon character and back-end code repurposed by an outside contractor from a health care system. In 2003, I managed a redesign of artonart.com that included cleaning and updating the Cold Fusion code, rewriting the SQL for the specialized searches, and streamlining the user interface. While the interface is now Flash-based, I decreased the page size by over 60% for most page templates. Overall the site is now more focused on displaying relevant search results quickly and accurately.
