This project was a complete redesign of the OWANA web site with the dual goals of providing easy access to neighborhood information and easy content management. The original site was a collection of static pages. Using WordPress as the CMS was a choice all users were already familiar with and provides a comfortable interface for the volunteer organization to make updates and upload relevant documents.
