TCAnet, the Texas Cultural and Arts Network, was developed in 1997 to enable art and cultural organizations in Texas to do business electronically. The site featured over 4,000 external links to a wide range of sites covering topics from tax issues, board development, artist resources, education materials and curriculum, among many others. TCAnet also housed up-to-date information on jobs in the arts, calls for entry for artists, and opportunities. The Commission distributed all of its publications and information through TCAnet including newsletters, artist rosters, funding information, and staff contacts.

I managed two major revisions of TCAnet. During the revision in 2000, I transformed the static pages into a dynamic database-driven site. I also designed a more readable key for the image maps on the home page of each section. I was not allowed to remove the image maps as TCA's Deputy Director had drawn them and believed we should keep them to provide a sense of continuity.

In 2002 I redesigned the interface again. Using valid HTML and CSS and removing unnecessary images,I reduced page size by an average of 70%. The redesign also ensured that the site was compliant with W3C accessibility standards and the U.S. Section 508 Guidelines.
