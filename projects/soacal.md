The UTSOA Calendar lists all events for the current semester including public lectures, symposia, meetings, information sessions, and reviews. The calendar is used by the faculty, staff, and students within the School as well as alumni and other visitors interested in architecture and events at the School.

<p>Before the calendar launched, various faculty and staff members maintained separate lists of the events for which they were responsible. Without a main calendar, events were frequently scheduled in conflict with each other. With the new centralized, online calendar, faculty and staff can check for conflicts before they schedule meetings and events. Also, calendar users can now locate events within a specific time period or interest area.

In early 2008, the calendar will be upgraded to include e-mail alerts for individual events, an expanded RSS feed, and a public form for faculty and staff to directly add events.
