The Texas Arts Exchange was a conference sponsored by the Texas Commission on the Arts. This event brought together individuals, groups and organizations involved in the arts in Texas to learn from each other, encourage the sharing of ideas and solutions, and forge new collaborations. The theme of the 2004 conference was "Tools for Results."

Online registration was a requirement for all participants. Although TCA was not able to accept payment online, by having the constituents complete the registration form on the site, the agency had a more exact number of participants and could personalize the conference for participants without time-consuming in-house data entry.
