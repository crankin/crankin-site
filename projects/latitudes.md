The Latitudes 2 project is a one-page site for a UTSOA-sponsored symposium. Since the print materials had already been designed, I decided to use the entire poster as the main navigation device. This "interactive poster" created a memorable experience and provided more detailed information about the presenters and the agenda. Instead of jumping between anchor points the window would scroll to the relevant information to preserve the feel of scanning a poster.
