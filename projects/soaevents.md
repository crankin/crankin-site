This single page site is an interactive interpretation of the UTSOA spring 2011 lectures and exhibitions poster. The events committee tasked me with developing and coding a site that could be the one-stop source for information on the lectures and the archive of the video of each event while using the format and layout of the printed poster as the foundation for the web design.

Using the combination of HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery, I developed a site that accomplished these goals across browser and devices. While not entirely "responsive," the site uses responsive web design techniques to scale the font sizes and other elements in order to look best across all browsing devices.
