I am a digital strategist, product manager, web developer, and interactive designer from Austin, Texas, with over 20 years of public sector and nonprofit experience working for organizations like KLRU, the UT Austin School of Architecture, the Texas Commission on the Arts, and the Austin Museum of Art. I also build websites for arts and cultural institutions, local small business, and my creative friends.

I infrequently write about current interests &mdash; art about technology, networks, public art, urban interventions, museums, animated GIFs &mdash; on my [blog](/).
