I figured now would be as good time as any to start going through the 100s of links I bookmarked with the intention to read later but have never looked at let only read. So here’s the first installment of what I’m calling “Read, Watch, Listen.” Hope you find something enjoyable. *Disclaimer: some of these are pretty old but hopefully still relevant or at least serve as interesting recent history.*

**[Year in Review: Museum admission should be free: The state of art in 2014 - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-ca-knight-art-essay-20141221-column.html)** — Christopher Knight writes about why museums should be free. I’ve agreed with this idea for years. And although museums look to be one of the many industries who are going to suffer financially, individual admission fees are not going to help them get back in the black. When they can reopen, museums should be waive admission fees, become a place of art and community, and find different revenue streams for their funding.

**[The dark future of American space exploration - Vox](https://www.vox.com/2015/2/23/8052365/nasa-budget-europa)** — This article is from 2015 so a lot has changed since then but NASA should be better funded because no other country can do space exploration like NASA can.

**[Night trailer for “Hippias Minor” exhibition by Paul Chan (June 15 - Sept 30, 2015) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0ceOF6p-w0&feature=emb_title)** — Drone footage of a Paul Chan exhibition for [DESTE Foundation for Contemporary Art](https://deste.gr/hydra/paul-chan-hippias-minor/) that includes three of those inflatable dancing guys and is soundtracked by a DJ Screw version of “In the Air Tonight.” Can’t miss.

**[Sarah Sudhoff | Point of Origin | grayDUCK Gallery](https://www.artsy.net/show/grayduck-gallery-sarah-sudhoff-point-of-origin)** — I like the worlds that Sarah Sudhoff creates and explores. I honestly don’t know much about this current exhibit but the install looks great and I’m using this as a reminder to actually get out see art and get involved and support artists in Austin.

**[Emory Douglas: The Art of The Black Panthers on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/128523144)** — Although this short is about 5 years old, it does a great job capturing some of what Emory Douglas, the first Revolutionary Artist and Minister of Culture for the Black Panther Party, is about and showcasing some of his better-known images. I included Douglas in my undergraduate honors thesis and could find very little information about his work at the time (early 90s). I was glad to see when he started getting more recognition and wider appreciation a few years back.

**[Arts And Tech Non-Profit Gray Area Is A Symbol For A Changing City – TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/30/gray-area/)**  — Even though it’s from 2014 and Gray Area has come a long way since then, this article does a great job of highlighting the work and effort — and especially the work and effort of Josette Melchor — that goes into starting a new nonprofit arts organization.
