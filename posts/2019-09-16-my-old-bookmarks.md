I’ve been using [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in) for my bookmarks for as long as I can remember — probably almost 15 years. With my current free time I’ve been reviewing some categories just to see what I had bookmarked. My explorations revealed a “blog” category of pages and posts I wanted to share that has over 100 links in it. 

Tomorrow I’m going through them year by year starting  with the oldest from June 2014. I’m not sure what I’ll find but I know I saved them because I felt like I had something to say about them. If nothing else we’ll get to see what time has done to the relevancy of the links and to the strength of my convictions.

Stay tuned!
