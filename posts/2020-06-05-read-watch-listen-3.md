**[Badlands Unlimited](http://badlandsunlimited.com/)** — I knew Badlands was closing. I didn’t realize they were gone. It was an interesting publishing project and it’s too bad it was no longer sustainable.

[After 15 years, a forest, a pig and a giant tongue, Echo Park alternative arts space Machine Project is closing its doors - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/miranda/la-et-cam-machine-project-20180104-htmlstory.html) — Mark Sears, director of the Machine Project, talks about five of his favorite projects from the organization’s history. Machine Project is definitely one of the models for the nonprofit arts space I dream of planning and running — a space that can help emerging artists produce exhibits and projects and is “about coalescing large groups of artists who weren’t represented by galleries and who weren’t being shown in museums.” Maybe one day I can find the time and partners to make something like it happen here in Austin.

[God Bless Russell Westbrook, May He Never Change  | GQ](https://www.gq.com/story/god-bless-russell-westbrook) — Even though he plays for the Rockets now (one of my least favorite teams in the league), Westbrook is still one of my favorite players because he plays hard every game and is willing to take the risks the make him brilliant even though he knows those risks might not always work and he’ll end up being called out for it. 

[A History of Violence: Jordan Wolfson on His Shocking Foray into VR at the Whitney  Biennial – ARTnews.com](https://www.artnews.com/art-news/artists/a-history-of-violence-jordan-wolfson-on-his-shocking-foray-into-vr-at-the-whitney-biennial-7856/) — Wolfson makes art that makes audiences (including myself) uncomfortable with looking at it. Creating a work in VR that subverts the traditional thinking that VR experiences can help us gain empathy with other people and perspectives is a brilliant concept.

Here are three articles about people with face-blindness which I have at least a mild case of and might be a result of the bike accident I was in a number of years ago. But I always say that’d I’d be the world’s worst spy because all you’d have to do would be to put on sunglasses and I’d never recognize you. It’s lead to a couple embarrassing social interactions and I can normally figure it out but I really on picking up other characteristics than someone’s face in order to identify them.

[Will the Retail Apocalypse Be Good for the Arts?](https://www.vulture.com/2018/06/will-the-retail-apocalypse-be-good-for-the-arts.html) — I’m all for using empty store fronts for temporary art spaces. I know it’s happened in Austin but not recently. Most spaces don’t need too much work to be useable for an art exhibit or performance and it’s a win-win as art organizations need the space and realty holding companies have empty buildings that they aren’t making money from anyway. Not sure what the future holds but it seems like a way to get people back into downtown or other areas of the city once we’re all done with this quarantine.

[How Spikeball became mainstream](https://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/23915064/how-spikeball-became-mainstream) — Quick story about how Spikeball gained popularity so quickly. They’ve been playing it at my kids’ middle school for at least three years now but I was still surprised to start seeing people playing in parks around Austin.
