I am a digital strategist / product manager / web developer / interactive designer from Austin, Texas, with over 20 years of public sector and nonprofit experience working for organizations like KLRU, the UT Austin School of Architecture, the Texas Commission on the Arts, and the Austin Museum of Art. I also build websites for arts and cultural institutions, local small business, and my creative friends.

I infrequently write about current interests &mdash; art about technology, networks, public art, urban interventions, museums, animated GIFs &mdash; on my [blog](https://getcrank.in/blog).

Have a project or idea you'd like to discuss? Please get in touch.



<!-- We were tired of the whiz-bang sites and jargon-filled presentations of web designers and developers and wanted to work with clients in a clear and productive relationship in order to create outstanding projects. We're flexible, we like to talk to our clients over good coffee (hint, hint) and understand their tech comfort level and most importantly their project goals.

We have experience creating web sites of all sizes, managing e-mail campaigns, developing blogs & social media pages, and launching a variety of interactive projects. We can provide planning, design and development services.

We believe that a great online experience (website?) not only looks good but works good too. A lovely site that isn't useful is bad design. Attention to detail in all parts of the process. We produce technical solutions which combine with elegant design to make something excellent.

We develop continuing partnerships and collaborations with our clients. We won't launch a project and then completely disappear (unless that's what you want).

We don't have a set process. We don't come to projects with a pre-defined process in place. We work with our clients to tailor the process.

We find solutions for our clients that they didn't know were possible within their understanding of the web and the size of their budget.

We believe that successful projects are both attractive and useful resources for your potential users and easy and powerful to administer for you and your staff.

We can guide you through the entire process — planning, designing, developing, and launching your web site.

We'd love to discuss your next project with you. We'd love to work with you. We'd love to partner with you. Contact us.

We like to work with non-profits, art and cultural groups, small businesses, and individuals. But we don't like to limit ourselves.
