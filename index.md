I am a digital strategist / product manager / web developer / interactive designer from Austin, Texas, with over 20 years of public sector and nonprofit experience working for organizations like KLRU, the UT Austin School of Architecture, the Texas Commission on the Arts, and the Austin Museum of Art. I also build websites for arts and cultural institutions, local small business, and my creative friends.
