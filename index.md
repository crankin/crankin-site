[Christopher Rankin](/resume/) is a digital strategist, product manager, web developer, and interactive designer from Austin, Texas, with over 20 years of public sector and nonprofit experience working for organizations like the [UT College of Liberal Arts](/projects/cola/), [KLRU-TV](/projects/klru), the [UT School of Architecture](/projects/utsoa), and the [Texas Commission on the Arts](/projects/tcanet/). I also build websites for [arts and cultural institutions](/projects/amp/), local [small business](/projects/mark/), and my [creative friends](/projects/medesign/).

I might start blogging again but until then I use [are.na](https://www.are.na/christopher-rankin) to collect cool sites and other things that interest me.

Have a project or idea you'd like to discuss? [Email me.](mailto:crankin@getcrank.in)
